CRITICAL NOTICE: BACKUP CORRUPTION DETECTED

All files in this backup appear to be corrupted.
Each file checked is exactly 710 bytes and contains a cPanel error message:
"Failed to load module “FileManager”: The system failed to load the module..."

This suggests the backup was not downloaded correctly from the server or the cPanel file manager was broken during the download process.

It is highly likely that NO usable data (images, database, code) can be recovered from this specific backup set.
