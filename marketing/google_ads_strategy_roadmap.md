## 🔮 Strategy Roadmap (Phase 2)

### 1. The "Similar Audience" Multiplier (Next Week)
*   **The Concept:** Use your existing customer data to find "clones".
*   **Action Plan:**
    *   [ ] User to export list of ~500 past customer emails.
    *   [ ] Upload to Google Ads "Shared Library > Audience Manager".
    *   [ ] Create a **"Similar to Purchasers"** segment.
    *   [ ] Apply this segment to the Campaign with "Observation" mode (boost bids for these people).
*   **Why:** This helps Google's AI find high-probability buyers (e.g., other Maids of Honour) much faster than random searching.

### 2. Negative Keyword Refinement (Ongoing)
*   **The Concept:** Stop paying for "Free" or "Job" seekers.
*   **Action Plan:**
    *   [ ] Weekly check of "Search Terms" report.
    *   [ ] Add negatives like: `job`, `vacancy`, `free`, `salary`, `model hire` (if people are looking to *hire* a model for a private art project rather than a party).

### 3. Landing Page A/B Testing
*   **The Concept:** Squeeze more leads from the same traffic.
*   **Action Plan:**
    *   [ ] Monitor the conversion rate of the new "Insider Tip" banner.
    *   [ ] Consider testing a "Price vs Agency" comparison table explicitly on the landing page.
